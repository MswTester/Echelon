      7  ## Code Style Guidelines
      8  - Use **two spaces** for indentation
      9  - Always terminate statements with a **semicolon**
     10  - Prefer `const` and `let`; avoid `var`
     11  - Keep import paths relative within a module; use `echelon/*` alias when importing from the framework
     12  - Use `function` declarations for decorators and exported helpers
