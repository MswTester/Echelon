## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Decorator-Driven Design
```typescript
@Component('div')
class ProductionComponent {
  @State() data = [];
  @Store('globalCache') cache = new Map();
  @Computed() processedData() { return this.data.filter(x => x.active); }
  @Event('click') handleClick() { /* optimized event handling */ }
  @Mounted() async initialize() { /* async lifecycle support */ }
}
```

### Advanced State Management
```typescript
// Global state synchronization
@Store('userSession') session = { user: null, auth: false };
@Use('userSession') sessionData = { user: null, auth: false };

// Computed properties with circular dependency protection
@Computed() 
get filteredItems() {
  return this.items.filter(item => item.status === this.filter);
}
```

### Performance-Optimized Event Handling
```typescript
// Event delegation with data attributes
@Event('click')
handleClick(event: MouseEvent) {
  const action = (event.target as HTMLElement).dataset.action;
  this.performAction(action); // Highly efficient routing
}
```

## 🎯 Production Use Cases

### Suitable For:
✅ **High-end web applications**
✅ **Complex dashboard interfaces** 
✅ **Real-time data visualization**
✅ **Interactive forms and workflows**
✅ **Single-page applications (SPAs)**
✅ **Component libraries and design systems**

### Performance Characteristics:
- **Startup time**: Fast (optimized decorator processing)
- **Runtime performance**: Excellent (batched updates, memoization)
- **Memory usage**: Efficient (object pooling, cleanup)
- **Bundle size**: Compact (minimal runtime overhead)
